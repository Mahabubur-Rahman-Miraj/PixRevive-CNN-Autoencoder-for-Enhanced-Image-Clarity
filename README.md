# PixRevive-CNN-Autoencoder-for-Enhanced-Image-Clarity
PixRevive: CNN Autoencoder for Enhanced Image Clarity is a deep learning project that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to restore blurred images. By training an autoencoder model, PixRevive learns to reconstruct images, improving clarity and revealing complex features for better visual representation.
